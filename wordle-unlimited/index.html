            <h3>Q1: What is the Wordle puzzle?</h3>
            <p>A1: The Wordle puzzle is an online word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a five-letter target
                word within six tries. Each guess is evaluated and feedback is provided to help players narrow down the

                into the provided space, and the system will provide feedback in the form of colored squares. A gray
                square indicates that the letter is not in the target word, while a yellow square indicates that the
                letter is in the target word but in the wrong position. A green square indicates a correct letter in the
                correct position.</p>
